introduction = """
I attempt to rate every piece of art I experience on the same 11-point scale from 0 to 5 inclusive.
This page collates all the ratings.
The specification for the score numbers is given below.
<details><summary>Score number specification</summary>

- 0.0: Actively harmful and really really bad, with zero artistic merit or interest.
- 0.5: Uninteresting, poorly conceived and terribly executed, not enjoyable at all.
- 1.0: Some interest, but it’s hard to find the good parts.
- 1.5: Might have a few well-done elements, but still held back in many ways.
- 2.0: Below average.
- 2.5: Average and safe. Not fascinating and I probably won’t come back to it, but worth
	experiencing.
- 3.0: Some real merit, displaying creätivity, skill and originality.
- 3.5: A serious amount of merit. Executed cleanly and has excellent consistency. Thoroughly
	enjoyable.
- 4.0: In the realm of excellence. The artist has made something quite special.
- 4.5: Goes above and beyond anything else in the field. Every aspect is near perfect.
- 5.0: Perfect, not in that it can’t be improved upon, but in that it truly masters everything
	it possibly could.

</details>

All music ratings here are additionally kept in sync with my [rateyourmusic] page.
