## About Me { #about-me }

I am a hobbyist Rust programmer,
mainly spending my time contributing to open source projects.
I've been using the language since October 2019,
before which I mostly used C and C++.
I am also decent at JavaScript and TypeScript, mostly in browser contexts.

I use feminine pronouns ("she/her")
and go by my first or full name in PascalCase or Title Case.
